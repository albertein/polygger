# polygger


polygger is package that installs the most common debugger incantations from different languages into your project, so it becomes easier to work on full stack applications involving multiple projects.

## Using it

To start using just require the file, once you do that magic stuff will happen and all debugging incantations available will be installed.

```python
require('polygger');
binding.pry; // This will launch the debugger
pdb.set_trace(); // This will too
```
